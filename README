I just started working on this pet project. The goal is a command-line utility that cleanups Mac stuff in foreign volumes/directories.

Motivation is: my ebook reader (iRex DR 1000S) stores files in a FAT16 SD card that ends up with hidden files like "emulated" resource forks and such. I want to tidy it up on a regular basis.

There's an application called "Hidden Cleaner" that supposedly does this, but it didn't really work for me.

More to come (hopefully).
